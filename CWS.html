    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <p>
    <div id="social"></div>Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or
    sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.
    The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of
    definition; however, there are some common features:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.</li>
        <li>User-generated content such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through
            all online interactions, is the lifeblood of social media.</li>
        <li>Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social
            media organization.</li>
        <li>Social media facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those
            of other individuals or groups.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>lUsers usually access social media services via web-based apps on desktops and laptops, or download services that
        offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with
        these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and
        organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate and modify user-generated content or self-curated
        content posted online. Networks formed through social media change the way groups of people interact and
        communicate or stand with the votes. They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between
        organizations, communities, and individuals".[1] These changes are the focus of the emerging fields of
        technoself studies. Social media differ from paper-based media (e.g., magazines and newspapers) and traditional
        electronic media such as TV broadcasting, Radio broadcasting in many ways, including quality,[5] reach,
        frequency, interactivity, usability, immediacy, and performance. Social media outlets operate in a dialogic
        transmission system (many sources to many receivers).[6]</p>
